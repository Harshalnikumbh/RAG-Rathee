Today, all over the world, bread is an extremely common food item. Everyone consumes it at all times. In India, it is consumed in numerous ways. Bread jam, bread gulab jamun, bread halwa, bread roll, bread pakoda, bread omelette, So you need to ask, what is in the bread? Is it beneficial or harmful to your health? What's the difference between white bread and brown bread? How does it compare to the Rotis?",

  "full_text": "Hello, friends! Have you ever looked at the back of the packet? The brown bread that you consider healthy, What are its ingredients? Today, all over the world, bread is an extremely common food item. Everyone consumes it at all times. In India, it is consumed in numerous ways. Bread jam, bread gulab jamun, bread halwa, bread roll, bread pakoda, bread omelette, So you need to ask, what is in the bread? Is it beneficial or harmful to your health? What's the difference between white bread and brown bread? How does it compare to the Rotis? What's the difference between white bread and brown bread? How does it compare to the Rotis? Similar to the analysis of soft drinks in the previous video, in this video, let's understand the bread in detail. \"You want to grow bigger and stronger, don't you? A sandwich daily and 2 slices of Wonder Bread every meal, will give you the 8 elements you need.\" \"All day long eat Sunbeam Bread and renew energy as you burn it up!\" \"Utilise the strength of steel for kneading and rising the dough, yeast, and make the bread even livelier.\" \"For wonderful flavour combined with sound food values, and make the bread even livelier.\" \"For wonderful flavour combined with sound food values, serve Schmidt's Blue Ribbon Bread in the pantry pack.\" \"Filled with the goodness of wheat, and health in every slice.\" Let's begin with the basics. What is a bread, actually? Basically, bread is made up of 4 main ingredients. First: flour. Whole wheat or refined, Second: water. The flour is kneaded into a dough using water. We do the same while making rotis. The flour is kneaded into a dough using water. We do the same while making rotis. Third: salt. And fourth: yeast. You'd ask about the purpose of putting salt in breads. There are three main reasons. First, salt is a natural antioxidant. It works as a natural preservative that enables us to store the bread longer. Second, the taste of the bread improves with salt. Third, and most importantly, the gluten strands strengthen with salt. The first stage of the process is kneading the dough. The first stage of the process is kneading the dough. When you do this, the gluten in the flour, come together so that the bread or the roti, remain in one piece. Putting salt in the dough strengthens the gluten strands. Then comes our fourth ingredient. Yeast. Friends, yeast is a single-celled microorganism included in the fungi group. In Hindi, it is known as Khameer. When these microorganisms react with the carbohydrates in the flour, two components are released. two components are released. Ethanol and Carbon Dioxide. As you already know from school, this process is known as fermentation. The carbon dioxide bubbles that are released in this reaction, get trapped in the gluten strands. This is why bread expands. As you'd notice in the photo, there are numerous round and oval bubbles in the bread, But in this reaction, ethanol is also released. As you know, ethanol is actually alcohol. What happens to the alcohol? When we put the fermented dough in the oven, What happens to the alcohol? When we put the fermented dough in the oven, and start baking it, the ethanol evaporates. The evaporating ethanol helps the bread expand more. An interesting fact here, the entire alcohol doesn't evaporate, a part of it remains trapped. The American Chemical Society ran some experiments in the 1920s, and found that the alcohol content in breads may be between 0.04% to 1.9%. No need to be wary of this. This tiny amount of alcohol will not harm you. No need to be wary of this. This tiny amount of alcohol will not harm you. In fact, those scientists observed that this remaining alcohol enhances the flavour of the bread. The bread tastes better due to this. Friends, this is the traditional way of making bread. Humans have been using this method for centuries, all across the globe, to make breads. In 1857, Louis Pasteur gave a scientific understanding of the fermentation process. After this, we came to know what is fermentation process actually. Before this, people were using this process without knowing what was happening. After this, we came to know what is fermentation process actually. Before this, people were using this process without knowing what was happening. Our roti and bread differ in only two ways. While making rotis, we do not use yeast or salt. That's why the rotis do not expand like the breads. And this is also why we cannot preserve the rotis for long. If you keep the rotis in room temperature, it wouldn't be edible a day later. Since the rotis do not expand, we categorise it as a flatbread. Since the rotis do not expand, we categorise it as a flatbread. Flatbreads like roti are popular all over the world. You'd find Mexican tortillas in Mexico, they resemble rotis a lot. Often tortillas are made of corn, while rotis are made of wheat. You'll find many such flatbreads in Southeast Asian countries. You'll find flatbreads in African countries as well. Who came up with the idea to put yeast in the normal flatbreads to make it expand? This is a topic of debate for historians. It is speculated that its origin was around 4,000 BC. to make it expand? This is a topic of debate for historians. It is speculated that its origin was around 4,000 BC. A baker in Egypt was making the traditional flatbread, when he kept the dough aside for some hours, There happened to be wild yeast in the air, that interacted with the dough. When the baker put the dough in his traditional oven, it started expanding. Everyone was surprised to see that. They found that it was softer to eat. Since they liked it, they decided to try to make it again. They found that it was softer to eat. Since they liked it, they decided to try to make it again. They believed that keeping the dough out in the open for some time will result in this bread. But the presence of wild yeast in the air was simply unpredictable. Often, it wasn't there. Then someone discovered that they could use the older dough containing yeast and keep it with the fresh dough to enable the transfer of yeast to the fresh dough. And so, steadily, humans developed the process of making breads. About 2,000 years ago, About 2,000 years ago, in 300 BC, in Ancient Rome, baking was considered to be an art. Baking was a respectable profession. Wheat was imported from African countries, from the regions in present-day Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt. It was imported into Rome to be made into bread. Moving on, it is said that Christopher Columbus, was the first to take the concept of bread to America. In India, the bread with yeast was brought by the Portuguese traders in the form of Pao. Yup, that's right. in the form of Pao. Yup, that's right. The Portuguese people introduced it to Goa first and then to Mumbai. This is why, even to this day, Mumbai's Vada Pav is very famous. Moving on, by the 1800s, the bread had become a natural homemade substance that had become a staple food in cultures all around the world. It was eaten every day. Making breads was considered to be a noble profession. And we saw bread enter Art, Religion, and even in Spirituality. Look at this famous painting. Jean-François Millet in which a woman is baking bread at home. Look at this famous painting. Jean-François Millet in which a woman is baking bread at home. And then, friends, the industrial revolution happened. A wholesome, homemade food like bread, turned into an industry. The commercialisation began with yeast. People didn't want to rely on wild yeast to bake their breads. They wanted to trap the yeast somehow. So that it could be used at will. And so the pressed yeast was introduced. So that it could be used at will. And so the pressed yeast was introduced. It was sold in the form of solid cubes. Some bakers in Vienna were credited with making the first pressed yeast in 1867. Today, we refer to it as Baker's Yeast. And you can buy a packet of it. And then, someone wondered why was the yeast needed. We used it to release a gas that helped the dough rise and the bread expand. They decided to use something else to do the same. Friends, this is where Sodium Bicarbonate came into the picture. Also known as Baking Soda. Friends, this is where Sodium Bicarbonate came into the picture. Also known as Baking Soda. Baking Soda reacts with the acid releasing Carbon Dioxide that helps in expanding the bread. But where does this acid come from? Back then, people introduced the acid in the dough by using milk, buttermilk, or even a few drops of lemon juice. After this, someone combined the baking soda with the acid and sold it. In a moisture-free packet that could contain the baking soda and the acidic substance. In a moisture-free packet that could contain the baking soda and the acidic substance. As soon as it is added to water, it starts reacting. This idea worked well. This is the baking powder. Baking powder contains baking soda with something acidic. You would have heard of ENO. While making Bhature, we add ENO to the flour. What does ENO contain? Baking Soda and Citric Acid. It was around the 1850s, when Baking Soda was first sold. A few years later, baking powder was being sold too. A few years later, baking powder was being sold too. These were the very first chemicals to be included in the bread. And after this, things started getting out of hand. In 1873, Edwin Lacroix improved the Swiss Steel Roller. This man created a machine that could efficiently separate the parts of wheat. First, let's look at the various parts of a grain of wheat. The outermost layer is known as Bran. It looks brown. Most of the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals are in this layer. The outermost layer is known as Bran. It looks brown. Most of the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals are in this layer. Under it is the thickest and largest part, the endosperm. This is mostly starchy carbohydrates. It isn't very nutrient-rich. And the innermost part is known as Germ. When we talk about whole wheat and refined wheat, the simple difference is that the outermost layer of bran is removed. The outermost layer is absent in refined flour the most nutritious part. It is the same as when you eat an apple. the most nutritious part. It is the same as when you eat an apple. You'd know that the most beneficial part of the apple is its skin. If you removed the skin and eat the apple, you do not get as many nutrients. The skin was the healthiest part of it. Friends, this is the difference between whole wheat flour and refined flour. Whole wheat flour is known as Atta in Hindi. And refined flour is known as Maida. With this new machine, after 1873, it was very easy to make refined flour. Though people did make refined flour before this, it wasn't as easy. it was very easy to make refined flour. Though people did make refined flour before this, it wasn't as easy. This was the first detrimental step in the history of bread. The second event following this was even worse. The wheat flour gets a white colour when it reacts with the atmospheric oxygen. But it takes some time for this reaction to take place. So the flour becomes white after some time. But these large-scale industries did not want to waste time. Time was money to them. They wanted to appease their customers. Time was money to them. They wanted to appease their customers. By showing them the white flour. They couldn't wait for the reaction to take place. So they started to whiten the flour by using chemicals such as chalk, alum, and borax. In 1898, bleaching agents were introduced. These companies started bleaching the flour. Simply because they wanted to lure the consumers with a whiter flour. These companies started bleaching the flour. Simply because they wanted to lure the consumers with a whiter flour. Patents were being filed in countries like Britain, the US, and France. Several people were strictly against this. They saw the harm in the practice. Several leaders raised their voices against this. Such as American Chemist Harvey Wiley. He used the slogan 'Save the Bread, Save the Nation.' But when the matter went into the courts, the bread manufacturers argued that since they were using a minuscule amount of nitrates and chemicals, the bread manufacturers argued that since they were using a minuscule amount of nitrates and chemicals, it wouldn't be very harmful. This is why, to date, flour is bleached in America. A bleaching agent chemical that is very famous is Potassium Bromate. Potassium Bromate was used in bread for the first time in 1916, not only did it make the bread whiter, but also helped it expand more. The problem is, today we know this chemical causes kidney problems, The problem is, today we know this chemical causes kidney problems, and thyroid cancer in rats. This is why this chemical has been banned in the European Union, Canada, Brazil, and China. What about India? In a lab study in May 2016, by the Centre for Science and Environment, to check the levels of harmful Potassium Bromate and Potassium Iodide, they tested 38 different bread samples. In 84% of the samples, either or both of the chemicals were present. In 84% of the samples, either or both of the chemicals were present. The good news is that, a few days after this study, the All India Bread Manufacturers' Association decided to stop using potassium bromate and potassium iodide in breads. A month later, the Indian government banned Potassium Bromate. And potassium iodide was referred to a scientific panel. Whether it was banned later or not, our researcher couldn't find any news item related to this, unfortunately. Shockingly, both chemicals are permitted in America. Shockingly, both chemicals are permitted in America. You'd think how could this be in a developed country like America. Friends, America is the country where Crony Capitalism was born. Many chemicals that have been banned in various parts of the world, you'd find them being freely used in America. Now, let's talk about the Artificial Preservatives. As I told you, salt was being used as a natural preservative. apart from this, we can use ginger, garlic, honey, clove, cinnamon, apart from this, we can use ginger, garlic, honey, clove, cinnamon, as natural preservatives to give a longer shelf life to food. When we make pickles, why can we store it for so long? Because it contains these natural preservatives. Such as salt, ginger, and garlic. In some places, breads contain these natural preservatives too. But over the last 100 years, the artificial preservatives gained popularity. 7th July 1928, for the first time, in an American bakery, 7th July 1928, for the first time, in an American bakery, sliced bread was sold. Till now, the bread that I was talking about, looked like this. But when you imagine bread, you might imagine the sliced bread. It was sold for the first time in 1928. But there was a big drawback. The drawback was that it became stale very quickly. This was a big flop when introduced. But over the next few years, with more preservatives were being added, But over the next few years, with more preservatives were being added, and the improvements in the shape, people started liking the sliced bread. In 1943, America banned sliced bread in order to save steel. But by that point in time, people were so used to the sliced bread that people started protesting against the ban. The ban was revoked 2 months later. The New York Times ran the headline: The biggest reason, as you can see from the headline, was convenience. The biggest reason, as you can see from the headline, was convenience. One had to slice the loaf of bread before this. It took a lot of effort to slice and store the bread. Sliced bread meant one could take out a slice and simply eat it. Let's fast forward to the present day. And investigate the ingredients of a typical bread. Once again, I'm assuming that none of the companies has lied. That they have honestly included everything in the ingredient list. So let's look at the back of a packet of white bread. So let's look at the back of a packet of white bread. The first ingredient on the list is refined wheat flour - 53%. As I told you, refined flour is made by taking off the bran from the wheat grains. The thing is, the fibre in the bran, helps in keeping the blood sugar stable. Without the bran, the carbohydrates in the wheat is released quickly into your blood-stream in the form of sugar. This results in a sugar spike. An Insulin spike. This results in a sugar spike. An Insulin spike. It's inconsequential if it happens once or twice. But if you keep on eating refined flour regularly for years, your body will develop insulin resistance which can eventually lead to Type II Diabetes. But there's a negative effect in the short term too. Refined flour increased the level of bad cholesterol in the body. One starts craving more food. And it leads to mood swings as well. Managing the sugar spikes from various foods, is a vast topic in and of itself, it can be discussed in much detail. is a vast topic in and of itself, it can be discussed in much detail. By effectively managing the sugar spikes, you can get rid of your fatigue, The second ingredient is sugar. Sugar refers to the extra-added sugar not the ones naturally present in food items. As I explained in the video on cold drinks, our body doesn't need any added sugar. The more added sugar you can avoid the better it is for you. By comparison, the natural sugar that you get in fruits, milk, grain, the better it is for you. By comparison, the natural sugar that you get in fruits, milk, grain, that is healthy for you. I won't get into the details here, you can watch the video on cold drinks if you want to understand sugars better. After this, the next ingredients are salt and emulsifier e-481. Salt contains sodium. And this emulsifier contains even more sodium. If you consume sodium in excess amounts, you can get high blood pressure. But when does sodium become too much? In the bread's nutritional information you'll see you can get high blood pressure. But when does sodium become too much? In the bread's nutritional information you'll see 100g of bread contains 497mg of sodium. Normally, people eat 4 or 5 slices of bread at a time. The slices weigh around 200g. If you use 30g butter with the bread, it adds another 250mg of sodium. This, friends, is half of your daily requirement. If you do not exceed the daily requirement, it is safe. You should be paying attention to it. If you have 4-5 buttered slices of bread, You should be paying attention to it. If you have 4-5 buttered slices of bread, it meets half the daily requirement of sodium. Research shows us that in America, the top contributor to dietary sodium is bread. If you consume so much bread, you need to pay attention to the salt in the rest of your meal. The next ingredient on the list is the Class II Preservative E282. This is Calcium Propionate. In a study published in June 2019, International Journal of Molecular Epidemiology and Genetics International Journal of Molecular Epidemiology and Genetics showed that this chemical can specifically cause allergies, intolerances, skin rashes, and migraine headaches. Before this, another study was conducted in August 2002, published in the Journal of Pediatrics and Child Health. It showed that if children consume the chemical daily, they show irritability they'll feel more irritated, they get restless, and it affects their attention span as well. Then comes the Acidity Regulator E270, they'll feel more irritated, they get restless, and it affects their attention span as well. Then comes the Acidity Regulator E270, this is the Lactic Acid. And the Antioxidant E300, the Ascorbic Acid. Both are generally recognised as safe and are permitted for use in most places. This is the present-day status, as per existing research. Now you'd accuse me of being cynical. \"As per existing research\" Shouldn't I be thinking positively instead? Shouldn't I be thinking positively instead? You're right, but as history has shown us we know that there's a 50:50 chance that a chemical or a preservative would later turn out to be harmful to our health. Think about the people living in the 1970s, 1980s, they would've consumed potassium bromate all their lives, And then one day they found out that it was so harmful to their health. Look at the website of the European Food Safety Authority. Look at the website of the European Food Safety Authority. Last year, a very common food colour E171 was banned. Think of the people who have been consuming this their whole lives. And now they find that the government banned it. This is just one example. Many substances get banned each year. And I'd say, the European Food Safety Authority has the strictest regulations. America's Food Regulation Authority keeps banning harmful chemicals regularly. America's Food Regulation Authority keeps banning harmful chemicals regularly. Look at the FDA website. synthetically-derived benzophenone, ethyl acrylate, methyl eugenol, myrcene, why were they banned? FDA claims that data and research showed that when these synthetic substances were used on animals they get cancer. This would make you wonder about everything you've consumed up till now. Why does no one talk about it? This would make you wonder about everything you've consumed up till now. Why does no one talk about it? Neither is anyone held accountable regarding this. Governments tell you that nothing can be done about whatever you've already consumed. And that you simply should not eat it anymore. And often, even if something is banned in one country, it may be allowed in others. Look at this article from The Guardian. This article from indiatimes.com Apart from these handful of articles, mainstream media doesn't cover these topics. How can it be that something banned from being consumed in Europe is being permitted in India and America? Anyway, let's talk about Brown Bread. Some people choose to eat brown bread instead of white bread. Assuming it to be a healthier option. The main difference in brown bread is that instead of refined flour, whole wheat flour is used. But if you look at the back of this famous brown bread, you'll see instead of refined flour, whole wheat flour is used. But if you look at the back of this famous brown bread, you'll see 53% of its weight is whole wheat flour, and you can see the rest of the ingredients as well. The artificial preservatives that are in it. In this brown bread by a famous company, can you spot anything interesting?
