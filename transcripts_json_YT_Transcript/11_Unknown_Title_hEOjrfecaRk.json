Despite that using the same brand name and taglines, and creating recall value for the pan masala, aren't the surrogate ads unfair? Aren't they unethical? In my opinion, it has a simple solution, the government should make such a law that any company selling alcohol or tobacco products under any brand name, shouldn't be allowed to use the same brand name and/or tagline for other products. shouldn't be allowed to use the same brand name and/or tagline for other products. If Vimal wants to sell its Vimal Pan Masala, then it shouldn't be allowed to name its other product Vimal Elaichi. Or any similar name. If Kingfisher Beer exists, Kingfisher Soda shouldn't. Both should have distinct brand names. Change the name of the Soda from Kingfisher to anything else. And it is a very simple solution. This should be banned. They shouldn't have the same brand names or similar brand names. This should be banned. They shouldn't have the same brand names or similar brand names. To do this, a strong political will is required. If the government wants to do this, they can do so immediately. But the entire responsibility can't be shifted on the government alone. If we put aside politics or the legal framework, there is some responsibility on the celebrities as well. That they shouldn't advertise such products. A Goan oncologist Dr Shekhar Salkar, the President of National Organisation for Tobacco Eradication, wrote an open letter to Amitabh Bachchan in September wrote an open letter to Amitabh Bachchan in September that he stop doing such ads and withdraw them immediately. On 9th October, I tweeted about it too. Specifically pointing out Amitabh Bachchan and Ranveer Singh, and many people had spoken out against it. Whenever celebrities come out with such ads. It's quite simple. These are rich people. Earning billions of rupees, so what is the desperation behind advertising such harmful products? What's the use of becoming an influencer or a celebrity if you start selling cancer to people? What's the use of becoming an influencer or a celebrity if you start selling cancer to people? After a large number of people spoke out against it, 2 days later, the news came in that Amitabh Bachchan, backed out of the ad for the pan masala. And that he had returned the money. It's yet to be seen how true it is. Because you can still see the same ad with Amitabh Bachchan on TV. Additionally, there is a long list of celebrities who are literally selling cancer to the people of the country. Ranveer Singh, Shahrukh Khan, Ajay Devgan, and many other celebrities that have starred in the ads for mouth fresheners in the past Ranveer Singh, Shahrukh Khan, Ajay Devgan, and many other celebrities that have starred in the ads for mouth fresheners in the past that were surrogate ads for pan masala, or 'cardamon' ads, Salman Khan, Hritik Roshan, Manoj Bajpayee, Tiger Shroff, Saif Ali Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Anushka Sharma, Sunny Leone, Govinda, Mahesh Babu, Ravi Kishan, Arbaaz Khan, Sanjay Dutt and Akshay Kumar. Though those celebrities should also be credited who used to star in these ads earlier but later when they realised that they were wrong, they stopped doing these ads. Like in 2016, when the Additional Director of the Delhi Government's Health Department but later when they realised that they were wrong, they stopped doing these ads. Like in 2016, when the Additional Director of the Delhi Government's Health Department openly appealed to all the celebrities, to stop being a part of such ads, Sunny Leone had promised that she wouldn't sign any future contracts for such products. But there are many unabashed actors that still continue to openly star in such ads. Ajay Devgan's classic ad that runs so frequently, \"It'll be glorious when the three friends meet.\" Another Bigpipers' ad featuring Shahrukh Khan. \"It'll be glorious when the three friends meet.\" Another Bigpipers' ad featuring Shahrukh Khan. Vimal's ad still runs with Shahrukh Khan and Ajay Devgan. Personally, I have no enmity against any celebrity. Many of the celebrities that I named now, are those whom I love to watch. I love their work. Shahrukh Khan, Akshay Kumar, Hritik Roshan, I love to watch these actors in films. Sonu Sood, I love how charitable he is. Manoj Bajpayee is one of the most talented actors here. Manoj Bajpayee is one of the most talented actors here. But it is very important to point out the wrong. Because these have a very negative impact on the citizens and our society. That's why it's important to point it out. If you watch your favourite celebrities doing such terrible surrogate ads, speak out against it. Don't become a blind follower of your favourite celebrity. Send this message to them on their social media and try to explain this to them politely. I hope there's some change for the better in our country after this video, and try to explain this to them politely. I hope there's some change for the better in our country after this video, regarding these things. Thank you very much!"
