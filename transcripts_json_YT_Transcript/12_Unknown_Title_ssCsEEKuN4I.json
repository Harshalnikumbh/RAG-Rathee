A 2015 study revealed that 60-70% dietary supplements consumed by people in the entire country are fake and unapproved. Whenever you are buying a protein supplement then be aware as to how you can recognize whether the product is authentic or not. Be mindful of the packaging. Look at texts on the packaging and the labels? Is written clearly or not or are there any grammatical mistakes? Is the logo on the package correctly placed or there are any mistakes with the logo. Is the logo on the package correctly placed or there are any mistakes with the logo. Quite often, fake products and logos have a lot of mistakes. You can easily make it out. Additionally, you should always buy from a reputable brand and from their website. Not like you are buying from Amazon because anyone can sell a fake product there. After protein, next is Zinc deficiency. Gujarat, Manipur, Punjab and Meghalaya have the highest percentage of Zinc deficiency. Almost 50% of children in age group 10-19 have Zinc deficiency. After protein, next is Zinc deficiency. Gujarat, Manipur, Punjab and Meghalaya have the highest percentage of Zinc deficiency. Almost 50% of children in age group 10-19 have Zinc deficiency. The best states in this regard are Nagaland, Mizoram and Haryana. Zinc deficiency can result in hair loss and diarrhoea. -So, Zinc is also...it is very interesting that you asked this question and that it showed up in the test results. Zinc is most commonly found in our food such as nuts (almonds, walnuts), pulses (dal, beans, rajma, chole) and grains (wheat, rice). Zinc is most commonly found in our food such as nuts (almonds, walnuts), pulses (dal, beans, rajma, chole) and grains (wheat, rice). Zinc deficiency is mostly found in people who have switched to a drastic diet and eliminates many things from their diet. -Oh...okay. -Zinc deficiency is more likely to be seen in such people. -Oh...okay. -Zinc deficiency is more likely to be seen in such people. So, if you are eating a balanced diet then we will get the Zinc from food itself. -So you are recommending that one should eat a balanced diet if there is Zinc deficiency? -For Zinc, yes! Next is Vitamin A deficiency. It’s lowest percentage is in Rajasthan, Sikkim and Goa. It is highest in Mizoram and Jharkhand. -So, Vitamin A too is like Iron. The body absorbs it much more when it comes from non-vegetarian food. It is found mostly in animal food such as eggs, milk as well as in all animal meats. As for vegetarian options, it is found in colourful vegetables such as red capsicum, carrots, yellow capsicum. All the colours- red, yellow, orange... -Yes...colourful fruits and vegetables. -So, fresh fruits...yes! Vegetables when consumed in the cooked form will have more absorption of Vitamin A because Vitamin A is such a nutrient that dissolves in fat. Next is the deficiency of Vitamin D. It is one of the only deficiencies which is found more in the rich and urban population as compared to the poor. This is because they stay less out in the sun. Sunlight is the source of Vitamin D. In fact it is one deficiency that I too have. I take supplements for the same. State wise- Assam, Tamil Nadu, Meghalaya and Nagaland has lowest deficiency while Punjab, Uttarakhand and Manipur has the highest. -So, in vegetarian food... Mushroom is one such vegetable that is quite rich in Vitamin D. -So, in vegetarian food... Mushroom is one such vegetable that is quite rich in Vitamin D. Another strategy is eggs. Eggs have Vitamin D content. Animal products have Vitamin D. Milk may have some Vitamin D but not a lot. What happens in the West is that in countries like the US is that dairy products are fortified with Vitamin D before being sold. -Oh...okay. So they generally add it in milk -Oh...okay. So they generally add it in milk Overall, leaving aside deficiencies, there is another great comparison that has been made in this report: which state consumes which food group and in how much quantity. Where are people eating less of what food? It is interesting to observe that. Haryana tops in Milk and curd. They are also given to children in good quantities in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Chattisgarh , Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand are placed at the bottom. Chattisgarh , Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand are placed at the bottom. The different comparisons that I am showing you of the food groups do not mean that if you live in these states then you should consume more of it. It is quite likely you might be consuming less of milk and curd and more of meat and therefore your dietary requirements get fulfilled anyway. These are generally such food groups that are main components of your diet and if it is being consumed less in your state then I would recommend you to eat more of it so that your diet is more balanced and varied. then I would recommend you to eat more of it so that your diet is more balanced and varied. Pulses and beans score well in Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Maharashtra while Mizoram, Meghalaya, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh fall quite far behind in consuming them. Green leafy vegetables score quite low in Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Tripura so if you live in these states then maybe you should concentrate on consuming green leafy vegetables. Fruits are consumed in abundance in Goa, Delhi, Kerala, Tamil Nadu while Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chattisgarh score quite low here. Fruits are consumed in abundance in Goa, Delhi, Kerala, Tamil Nadu while Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chattisgarh score quite low here. Although, I would say that this chart could have a relation with poverty because poor people do not have money to buy fruits Therefore, the states with higher rates of poverty rank here at the bottom. Root and tubers fall behind in Punjab, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh. These are vegetables that grow under the soil such as potato and Radish. For the rest of the vegetables, Punjab, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh score quite low. So, people living in these states need to eat vegetables a lot. Telegana, Tamil Nadu and Odisha are performing quite well. -People consume less of vegetables and more of roti and rice. This is what you have noticed? -Yes, yes. Compared to the amount of roti and rice people consume, the quantity of vegetables is far lesser. Generally, what the norm should be is vegetables should be double the quantity of roti or rice that you consume. But the opposite is always true. We consume more quantity of rice and the quantity of vegetables is less. Chicken and meat is obviously consumed less in vegetarian states. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu feature in the top here. This is something I would like to say is not necessary as I am myself a vegetarian. It is possible to meet your dietary requirements without consuming chicken and meat. It is a little difficult but it is possible. You can do so by consuming more dairy. If you do not want to consume dairy and become vegan then it becomes a little more difficult yet it is possible. A similar trend is seen for fish and eggs. Kerala, Goa, Assam and west Bengal consume fish the most. Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana which are vegetarian states always feature at the bottom.
